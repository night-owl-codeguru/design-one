## Design Philosophy

**Brutalism meets Neomorphism**: Combines harsh, bold brutalist elements (thick borders, stark shadows, bold typography) with soft neomorphic depth (subtle gradients, layered shadows, dimensional cards) to create a unique "brutal morph" aesthetic that's both edgy and approachable—perfect for TJ's brand identity.

## Brand Guidelines

- **Primary Font**: DIN Next LT Pro (headlines, body)
- **Secondary Font**: Optima Bold (brand line, beer variants)
- **Typography**: Generous kerning, bold weights, uppercase for emphasis
- **Color Usage**: Golden Pour for primary actions, Burnt Copper for accents, Dark Roast for base
- **Visual Style**: "Energy over perfection", "emotion is the hero"
